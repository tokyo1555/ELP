# 🖼️ Immage Filters in Go

This project implements **image processing filters in Go**, both **sequential** and **parallel**, using **goroutines**, a **TCP client–server architecture**, and several **performance analysis programs**.

The goal is to study parallelism, scalability, and performance trade-offs in Go.
This project was made by Farah Gattoufi, Anas Sfar and Yousra Mounim.

## 🎨 Available Filters

- `grayscale` – grayscale conversion  
- `invert` – color inversion  
- `blur` – box blur  
- `sobel` – edge detection  
- `median` – median filter  
- `pixelate` – mosaic effect  
- `PosterizeQuantilesColor` – color posterization effect

⚠️ Important : The image needs to be in the same file as the scripts you want to run.

## 🌐 TCP Client–Server Mode

### Run the server

```bash
go run server.go parallel.go
```

- Applies filters in parallel
- Allows or automatically selects the number of workers
- Measures filter execution time

---

### Run the client

```bash
go run client.gov *name of the image*
```

The client:
- Displays filter descriptions
- Saves the output in the same format
- Displays server-side execution time

---

## 📊 Performance Analysis

### Image size impact

```bash
go run image_size.go parallel.go seq.go
```

### Sequential vs Parallel

```bash
go run seq_vs_parallel.go parallel.go seq.go
```

### Worker scalability

```bash
go run scaling_workers.go parallel.go seq.go
```
